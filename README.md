# hypothesis-faker

Some [faker](https://github.com/joke2k/faker/) providers ported to [hypothesis](https://github.com/HypothesisWorks/hypothesis)
strategies

## Introduction

Hypothesis is great, but sometime you need domain-specific data outside of the
standard hypothesis extras. This is where faker shines -- many domains have been
carved out and explored. This is why I decided to port some faker providers to
hypothesis strategies.

## Installation

```bash
pip install hypothesis-faker
```

## Available strategies

Please refer to the [package root](https://github.com/dycw/hypothesis-faker/blob/master/src/hypothesis_faker/__init__.py).
